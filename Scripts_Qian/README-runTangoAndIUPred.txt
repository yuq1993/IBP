To run tango and iupred

As it will be too slow if not running parallely
So here, should first generate folder for each chromosome, then copy each script into each folder (expect run_tango.py)
Run them parallely
Finally, cat resukts together

PS. IUPred can only run where it is installed, so needs to be copyed to each folder as well

#### IUPred ###
follow run_iupred.sh

#### Tango ###
first run run_tango_generatefiles.py
then generate shlist.txt for all sh file
then run run_tango_runsh.sh
then tango_pfam.py which generate tango score of each domain, using file generated by PFAM
finally run run_tango.py which generate old tango score and new tango score for each transcript and calculate dTango
